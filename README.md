# dist-sys-practice
My practice of writing a distributed system in Go.

I validated my system with a benmark tool, [maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom).
Besides, there was a guide of writing different types of distributed algorithms provided along with the tool.
Therefore, I followed it and implemented mine step by step.
